# CAN_communication_STM32

I designed a CAN communuication protocol Between STM32 microcontrollers using C. This framework can be used to transmit and store CAN messages between many nodes using DMA and Interrupts.

This program for STM32f103x microcontrollers can be adapted to other STM32 for multi-master communication. I have attached the relevant project, main and interrupt files.
